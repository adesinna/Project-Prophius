1. EKS Master Role (aws_iam_role.master):
   This IAM role is meant to be assumed by the EKS service to manage the EKS cluster.

2. EKS Master Role Policies (aws_iam_role_policy_attachment):
   - AmazonEKSClusterPolicy: Allows the EKS service to manage the cluster.
   - AmazonEKSServicePolicy: Allows the EKS service to interact with other AWS services required to manage the cluster.
   - AmazonEKSVPCResourceController: Allows the EKS service to manage VPC resources in the cluster.

3. EKS Worker Role (aws_iam_role.worker):
   This IAM role is meant to be assumed by EC2 instances running as EKS worker nodes.

4. Custom Autoscaler Policy (aws_iam_policy.autoscaler):
   Defines a custom IAM policy that grants permissions related to autoscaling EKS resources and EC2 instances.

5. Worker Role Policies (aws_iam_role_policy_attachment):
   - AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy: Provides permissions for worker nodes to interact with the EKS control plane.
   - AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy: Allows worker nodes to manage CNI (Container Network Interface) related tasks.
   - AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore: Grants access for Systems Manager on worker nodes.
   - AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly: Allows read-only access to the ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for pulling container images.
   - AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess: Provides access for X-Ray tracing capabilities.
   - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess: Allows read-only access to Amazon S3 buckets.
   - autoscaler: Attaches the custom autoscaler policy defined earlier.

6. Worker Instance Profile (aws_iam_instance_profile.worker):
   Defines an IAM instance profile, which associates the worker IAM role with EC2 instances running in the EKS worker nodes.
   This allows the instances to assume the worker role and access the necessary resources.

The IAM roles, policies, and instance profiles defined in this code are crucial for setting up and managing EKS clusters
and their worker nodes. They ensure that the right permissions are granted to the EKS service and worker nodes for seamless cluster operation.
