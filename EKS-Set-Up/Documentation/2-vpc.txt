- cidr_block:
    This specifies the IP address range for your VPC. The VPC will have an IP address range of
    "10.0.0.0/16".

- tags:
    This is a map of key-value pairs used for tagging resources in AWS.
    In this case, I am tagging the VPC with a single tag where the key is "Name" and the value is "Prophius-VPC".
    This tag can help you identify and manage your resources more easily.
