1. EKS Cluster Resource (aws_eks_cluster.eks):
   This resource defines the creation and configuration of an EKS cluster.

   - name: "prophius-eks"
     The name of the EKS cluster.

   - role_arn: aws_iam_role.master.arn
     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role you've defined earlier that the EKS cluster assumes. This role has the necessary permissions to manage the cluster.

   - vpc_config:
     This block defines the networking configuration for the EKS cluster.

     - subnet_ids: [aws_subnet.public-1.id, aws_subnet.public-2.id]
       A list of subnet IDs from your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where you want to deploy the EKS cluster. These subnets should ideally span multiple availability zones for high availability.

2. depends_on:
   This attribute lists resources that the EKS cluster depends on before it's created. These dependencies ensure that the IAM role policies are attached before creating the EKS cluster.

   - aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.AmazonEKSClusterPolicy: The IAM policy attachment that grants permissions for the EKS cluster.
   - aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.AmazonEKSServicePolicy: The IAM policy attachment that grants permissions for the EKS service.
   - aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.AmazonEKSVPCResourceController: The IAM policy attachment for VPC resource management.
