1. The first `provider "docker"` block is configuring the local Docker daemon provider. It specifies the communication
 protocol and path to the Docker socket (`unix:///var/run/docker.sock`). This allows Terraform to manage Docker resources
  on the local machine.

2. The second `provider "docker"` block uses an alias (`registry`) to configure a Docker provider for interacting with a
    Docker registry. It's using the Docker Hub registry (`https://index.docker.io/v1/`) and sets up authentication for pulling
    and pushing images to the registry.
